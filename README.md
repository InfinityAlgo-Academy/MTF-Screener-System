## 📖 Overview

**MTF Screener MA Cross System** is a revolutionary multi-timeframe analytical framework designed for professional traders who demand comprehensive market analysis at a glance. This sophisticated tool integrates moving average cross logic with higher timeframe context analysis, providing you with a complete picture of market dynamics across multiple timeframes simultaneously.

### Why Choose MTF Screener?

Traditional single-timeframe analysis often leads to false signals because it misses the bigger picture. A bullish signal on H1 might be fighting against a strong bearish trend on H4. The MTF Screener solves this by showing you all timeframes at once, helping you trade **with the trend** rather than against it.

### Trading Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Trend Following
Wait for all monitored timeframes to show the same trend direction. Enter when the lower timeframe MA cross confirms the higher timeframe trend.

**Entry:** Fast MA crosses above Slow MA on M15 while H1 and H4 are bullish  
**Stop Loss:** Below recent swing low  
**Take Profit:** 2-3x risk or at key resistance level

#### Strategy 2: Pullback Trading
Identify strong trends on higher timeframes, then wait for pullbacks to key MA levels on lower timeframes.

**Entry:** Price pulls back to touch Slow MA, then Fast MA crosses up on M15  
**Stop Loss:** Below the pullback low  
**Take Profit:** Next resistance level or previous swing high

#### Strategy 3: Multi-Timeframe Confluence
The most powerful approach - wait for simultaneous MA cross signals on multiple timeframes.

**Entry:** Bullish cross on M15, H1, AND H4 within 1-2 candles  
**Stop Loss:** Below the cross formation  
**Take Profit:** 3-5x risk due to high probability
